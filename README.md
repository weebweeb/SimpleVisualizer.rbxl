# SimpleVisualizer.rbxl
 
This is a simple music "bar" waveform visualizer I created for public use on the Roblox platform in Rojo format. Existing knowldge of Rojo is a requirement to use this.

# Use
This is in Rojo format.
Run `serve` in rojo under the downloaded file, launch the included rbxl file under `rbx/` and sync it with the rojo plugin.
